## Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

What I learned on this mini-project.

*******

### let

Using let for variable assignments is useful when you expect the the variable to change.

``` javascript
let lastChecked;
```

This is different to `const` which is for variables you wish to remain constant throughout the script.

### shiftKey

You can use the shiftKey property of an event to check if its active

``` javascript
event.shiftKey;
```

In this case, this is used for a `click` event

### checked

To check whether a checkbox has been checked or not, you can assess its `checked` property

``` javascript
checkbox.checked;
```
