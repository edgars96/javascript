## Webcam Fun

What I learned on this mini-project.

*******

### video

The source of your video is in the form of a URL, that can be generated by the
`navigator` object. This is done by its property `mediaDevices` which in turn
calls a property `getUserMedia`.

The result of this is a `promise` that when successful, is used to generate
the URL.

``` javascript
video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(localMediaStream);
```

### pixels

Browsers interpret images as a series of pixels `rgba` values that are stored
in a large array of millions of values.

In this array, every pixel has four entries, one for each `rgba`. So for example

- [0, 1, 2, 3] Would mean a red value of 0, green value of 1 etc...

In this case, the pixels are drawn onto the canvas via `drawImage` which takes
in the

- video stream
- starting x coordinate
- starting y coordinate
- width
- height

### insertBefore

This method provides the same functionality as `prepend` from jQuery.

``` javascript
strip.insertBefore(link, strip.firstChild);
```

Here, `strip` represents a div element.
